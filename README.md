# DiagramDetective 🕵🏾‍♀️

## ToDo's:
1. GraphMorphism class together with taking images / reflecting name changes using signals/slots.
2. DiagramRules/Properties (what should we call them; where do they reside etc).  These are each of the type ForAll ... There Exists (dashed lines drawn).
3. It's true that even surjection can be written as a single ForAll...Exists (dashed lines)diagram, and so can most definitions / theorems.
4. Cancel R-Mod as functor - it is not a match to how we typically think about R-Modules as structured sets.  
5. If a category doesn't "have binary products", then introducing a product is under a supposition that it exists and thus a hypothesis to a theorem builder.
6. Consider going through Weibel and classifying the types of statements made "... then this row is exact", "... there exists a well-defined hom from X to Y.", etc.
7. Rounded-corner rect, colored tags as properties on objects, diagrams, arrows: "injective", "chain complex", "reverse chain complex", 
"-- exact --" at different angles of sequence arrows.  These can be enabled from the context menu, or disabled by right-clicking and going
to the tag's context menu, and then "Remove property".
8. Directory library of .dd Scene pickles which represent above-mentioned DiagramRules.  E.g. category-theory > morphism > epimorphism > definition.dd
